# Task List

<!--
Tasks are managed via Claude Code commands:
- "task add: <description>" - Add a new task
- "task list" - Show all tasks
- "task <number>" - Work on a specific task
- "task done <number>" - Mark a task as completed

## 1. Add configurable task types with account settings screen

**Status:** pending | **Added:** 2026-01-21

Make the task types configurable. We need an account screen where you configure your types—for example, admin, business, personal, etc. All the types we already have would become part of the configurable types. It should also allow me to add a new type, like Notetaker app. For now, we can just focus on adding types. We don't need to think about how we would manage deleting types right now, because that would involve handling what happens to the tasks you previously had with that type.
